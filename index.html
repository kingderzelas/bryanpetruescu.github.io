	<h1>Week 2: Testing your understanding</h1>
    <p>A topic that I find interesting is the topic of <a href="https://discgolf.com/">disc golf</a> due to the <strong>complex</strong> nature
		of the discs that can be presented, yet the <strong>simplicity</strong> of the game itself.
		You can have dozens upon dozens of discs that will all behave differently when
		you throw them, but also how you throw them. Yet, you can <strong>achieve so much</strong> if you
		have at least a good throwing form.</p>
